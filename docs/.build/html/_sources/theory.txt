The fitting procedure to extract the temperature from only the shape of the cloud seems to be most sensitive for temperatures between T/T_F = 0.05 and T/T_F = 0.4. For higher T/T_F the cloud starts to resemble a Gaussian and for lower T/T_F the differences become small because a smaller fraction of the atoms contributes to deviations in shape. In the figure below we can see the relative changes in shape for curves with different T/T_F fitted to the same image.

The fits seem to be more reliable when the optical density in the center of the cloud does not exceed 1.2.
